// It will compact keys with versions older than given interval.
// In other words, after compaction, it will only contain keys set during last interval.
// Any API call for the older versions of keys will return error.
// Interval is the time interval between each compaction. The first compaction happens after "interval".
func compactor(ctx context.Context, client *clientv3.Client, interval time.Duration) {
	// Technical definitions:
	// We have a special key in etcd defined as *compactRevKey*.
	// compactRevKey's value will be set to the string of last compacted revision.
	// compactRevKey's version will be used as logical time for comparison. THe version is referred as compact time.
	// Initially, because the key doesn't exist, the compact time (version) is 0.
	//
	// Algorithm:
	// - Compare to see if (local compact_time) = (remote compact_time).
	// - If yes, increment both local and remote compact_time, and do a compaction.
	// - If not, set local to remote compact_time.
	//
	// Technical details/insights:
	//
	// The protocol here is lease based. If one compactor CAS successfully, the others would know it when they fail in
	// CAS later and would try again in 10 minutes. If an APIServer crashed, another one would "take over" the lease.
	//
	// For example, in the following diagram, we have a compactor C1 doing compaction in t1, t2. Another compactor C2
	// at t1' (t1 < t1' < t2) would CAS fail, set its known oldRev to rev at t1', and try again in t2' (t2' > t2).
	// If C1 crashed and wouldn't compact at t2, C2 would CAS successfully at t2'.
	//
	//                 oldRev(t2)     curRev(t2)
	//                                  +
	//   oldRev        curRev           |
	//     +             +              |
	//     |             |              |
	//     |             |    t1'       |     t2'
	// +---v-------------v----^---------v------^---->
	//     t0           t1             t2
	//
	// We have the guarantees:
	// - in normal cases, the interval is 10 minutes.
	// - in failover, the interval is >10m and <20m
	//
	// FAQ:
	// - What if time is not accurate? We don't care as long as someone did the compaction. Atomicity is ensured using
	//   etcd API.
	// - What happened under heavy load scenarios? Initially, each apiserver will do only one compaction
	//   every 10 minutes. This is very unlikely affecting or affected w.r.t. server load.
