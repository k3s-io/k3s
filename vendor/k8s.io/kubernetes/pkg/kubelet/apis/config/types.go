	// Each entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path.
	// Globs can be used in the domain, but not in the port or the path. Globs are supported
	// as subdomains like '*.k8s.io' or 'k8s.*.io', and top-level-domains such as 'k8s.*'.
	// Matching partial subdomains like 'app*.k8s.io' is also supported. Each glob can only match
	// a single subdomain segment, so *.io does not match *.k8s.io.
	//
	// A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:
	// - Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.
	// - The URL path of an imageMatch must be a prefix of the target image URL path.
	// - If the imageMatch contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.
	//
	// Example values of matchImages:
	//   - 123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
	//   - *.azurecr.io
	//   - gcr.io
	//   - *.*.registry.io
