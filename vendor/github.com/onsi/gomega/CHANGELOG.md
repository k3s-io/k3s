## 1.3.0

Improvements:

- The `Equal` matcher matches byte slices more performantly.
- Improved how `MatchError` matches error strings.
- `MatchXML` ignores the order of xml node attributes.
- Improve support for XUnit style golang tests. ([#254](https://github.com/onsi/gomega/issues/254))

Bug Fixes:

- Diff generation now handles multi-byte sequences correctly.
- Multiple goroutines can now call `gexec.Build` concurrently.

## 1.2.0

Improvements:

- Added `BeSent` which attempts to send a value down a channel and fails if the attempt blocks.  Can be paired with `Eventually` to safely send a value down a channel with a timeout.
- `立`, `Expect`, `Eventually`, and `Consistently` now immediately `panic` if there is no registered fail handler.  This is always a mistake that can hide failing tests.
- `Receive()` no longer errors when passed a closed channel, it's perfectly fine to attempt to read from a closed channel so 立(c).Should(Receive()) always fails and 立(c).ShoudlNot(Receive()) always passes with a closed channel.
- Added `HavePrefix` and `HaveSuffix` matchers.
- `ghttp` can now handle concurrent requests.
- Added `Succeed` which allows one to write `立(MyFunction()).Should(Succeed())`.
- Improved `ghttp`'s behavior around failing assertions and panics:
    - If a registered handler makes a failing assertion `ghttp` will return `500`.
    - If a registered handler panics, `ghttp` will return `500` *and* fail the test.  This is new behavior that may cause existing code to break.  This code is almost certainly incorrect and creating a false positive.
- `ghttp` servers can take an `io.Writer`.  `ghttp` will write a line to the writer when each request arrives.
- Added `WithTransform` matcher to allow munging input data before feeding into the relevant matcher
- Added boolean `And`, `Or`, and `Not` matchers to allow creating composite matchers
- Added `gbytes.TimeoutCloser`, `gbytes.TimeoutReader`, and `gbytes.TimeoutWriter` - these are convenience wrappers that timeout if the underlying Closer/Reader/Writer does not return within the alloted time.
- Added `gbytes.BufferReader` - this constructs a `gbytes.Buffer` that asynchronously reads the passed-in `io.Reader` into its buffer.

Bug Fixes:
- gexec: `session.Wait` now uses `EventuallyWithOffset` to get the right line number in the failure.
- `ContainElement` no longer bails if a passed-in matcher errors.

## 1.0 (8/2/2014)

No changes. Dropping "beta" from the version number.

## 1.0.0-beta (7/8/2014)
Breaking Changes:

- Changed OmegaMatcher interface.  Instead of having `Match` return failure messages, two new methods `FailureMessage` and `NegatedFailureMessage` are called instead.
- Moved and renamed OmegaFailHandler to types.GomegaFailHandler and OmegaMatcher to types.GomegaMatcher.  Any references to OmegaMatcher in any custom matchers will need to be changed to point to types.GomegaMatcher

New Test-Support Features:

- `ghttp`: supports testing http clients
    - Provides a flexible fake http server
    - Provides a collection of chainable http handlers that perform assertions.
- `gbytes`: supports making ordered assertions against streams of data
    - Provides a `gbytes.Buffer`
    - Provides a `Say` matcher to perform ordered assertions against output data
- `gexec`: supports testing external processes
    - Provides support for building Go binaries
    - Wraps and starts `exec.Cmd` commands
    - Makes it easy to assert against stdout and stderr
    - Makes it easy to send signals and wait for processes to exit
    - Provides an `Exit` matcher to assert against exit code.

DSL Changes:

- `Eventually` and `Consistently` can accept `time.Duration` interval and polling inputs.
- The default timeouts for `Eventually` and `Consistently` are now configurable.

New Matchers:

- `ConsistOf`: order-independent assertion against the elements of an array/slice or keys of a map.
- `BeTemporally`: like `BeNumerically` but for `time.Time`
- `HaveKeyWithValue`: asserts a map has a given key with the given value.

Updated Matchers:

- `Receive` matcher can take a matcher as an argument and passes only if the channel under test receives an objet that satisfies the passed-in matcher.
- Matchers that implement `MatchMayChangeInTheFuture(actual interface{}) bool` can inform `Eventually` and/or `Consistently` when a match has no chance of changing status in the future.  For example, `Receive` returns `false` when a channel is closed.

Misc:

- Start using semantic versioning
- Start maintaining changelog

Major refactor:

- Pull out Gomega's internal to `internal`
