Package `socket` provides a low-level network connection type which integrates
with Go's runtime network poller to provide asynchronous I/O and deadline
support. MIT Licensed.

This package focuses on UNIX-like operating systems which make use of BSD
sockets system call APIs. It is meant to be used as a foundation for the
creation of operating system-specific socket packages, for socket families such
as Linux's `AF_NETLINK`, `AF_PACKET`, or `AF_VSOCK`. This package should not be
used directly in end user applications.

Any use of package socket should be guarded by build tags, as one would also
use when importing the `syscall` or `golang.org/x/sys` packages.
