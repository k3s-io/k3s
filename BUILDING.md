See the [release](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/latest) page for pre-built releases.

The clone will be much faster on this repo if you do
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rancher/k3s.git
```

This repo includes all of Kubernetes history so `--depth 1` will avoid most of that.

The k3s build process requires some autogenerated code and remote artifacts that are not checked in to version control.
To prepare these resources for your build environment, run:.
```bash
mkdir -p build/data && make download && make generate
```

To build the full release binary, you may now run `make`, which will create `./dist/artifacts/k3s`.

To build the binaries using without running linting (ie; if you have uncommitted changes):
```bash
SKIP_VALIDATE=true make
```

If you make any changes to go.mod and want to update the vendored modules, you should run the following before running `make`:
```bash
go mod vendor && go mod tidy
```

Kubernetes Source
-----------------

The source code for Kubernetes is in `vendor/` and the location from which that is copied
is in `./go.mod`.  Go to the referenced repo/tag and you'll find all the patches applied
to upstream Kubernetes.
