Thanks for helping us to improve k3s! We welcome all bug reports. At this stage, we are also looking for help in testing/QAing fixes. Once we've fixed you're issue, we'll ping you in the comments to see if you can verify the fix. We'll give you details on what version can be used to test the fix. Additionally, if you are interested in testing fixes that you ***didn't*** report, look for the issues with the `status/to-test` label. You can pick any of these up for verification.  ***You can delete this message portion of the bug report.***
