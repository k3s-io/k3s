name: Trivy Scan Trigger

# This workflow is triggered when a pull request is labeled with 'scan-with-trivy'.
# This can only be initiated by a user who is a member of the k3s-io organization and has write permissions.
# It isolates the built of k3s within a unprivileged enviroment. 
# The follow up unprivileged workflow will then use the artifact created here to run the scan
# and report the results back to the PR.
