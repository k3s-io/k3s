# Certificate Rotation

By default, certificates in K3s expire in 12 months.

If the certificates are expired or have fewer than 90 days remaining before they expire, the certificates are rotated when K3s is restarted.

# Auto-Deploying Manifests

Any file found in `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests` will automatically be deployed to Kubernetes in a manner similar to `kubectl apply`, both on startup and when the file is changed on disk. Deleting files out of this directory will not delete the corresponding resources from the cluster.

For information about deploying Helm charts, refer to the section about [Helm.](../helm)

# Using Docker as the Container Runtime

K3s includes and defaults to [containerd,](https://containerd.io/) an industry-standard container runtime.

To use Docker instead of containerd,

1. Install Docker on the K3s node. One of Rancher's [Docker installation scripts](https://github.com/rancher/install-docker) can be used to install Docker:

    ```
    curl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/19.03.sh | sh
    ```

1. Install K3s using the `--docker` option:

    ```
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker
    ```

1. Confirm that the cluster is available:

    ```
    $ sudo k3s kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    kube-system   local-path-provisioner-6d59f47c7-lncxn   1/1     Running     0          51s
    kube-system   metrics-server-7566d596c8-9tnck          1/1     Running     0          51s
    kube-system   helm-install-traefik-mbkn9               0/1     Completed   1          51s
    kube-system   coredns-8655855d6-rtbnb                  1/1     Running     0          51s
    kube-system   svclb-traefik-jbmvl                      2/2     Running     0          43s
    kube-system   traefik-758cd5fc85-2wz97                 1/1     Running     0          43s
    ```

1. Confirm that the Docker containers are running:

    ```
    $ sudo docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

### Optional: Use crictl with Docker

crictl provides a CLI for CRI-compatible container runtimes.

If you would like to use crictl after installing K3s with the `--docker` option, install crictl using the [official documentation:](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/blob/master/docs/crictl.md) 

```
$ VERSION="v1.17.0"
$ curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases/download/$VERSION/crictl-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz --output crictl-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ sudo tar zxvf crictl-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
crictl
```

Then start using crictl commands:

```
$ sudo crictl version
Version:  0.1.0
RuntimeName:  docker
RuntimeVersion:  19.03.9
RuntimeApiVersion:  1.40.0
$ sudo crictl images
IMAGE                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            SIZE

```

# Using etcdctl

etcdctl provides a CLI for etcd.

If you would like to use etcdctl after installing K3s with embedded etcd, install etcdctl using the [official documentation.](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/install/) 

```
$ VERSION="v3.5.0"
$ curl -L https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/${VERSION}/etcd-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz --output etcdctl-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ sudo tar -zxvf etcdctl-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```

Then start using etcdctl commands with the appropriate K3s flags:

```
$ sudo etcdctl --cacert=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/etcd/server-ca.crt --cert=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/etcd/client.crt --key=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/etcd/client.key version
```

# Configuring containerd

K3s will generate config.toml for containerd in `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml`.

For advanced customization for this file you can create another file called `config.toml.tmpl` in the same directory and it will be used instead.

The `config.toml.tmpl` will be treated as a Go template file, and the `config.Node` structure is being passed to the template. [This template](https://github.com/rancher/k3s/blob/master/pkg/agent/templates/templates.go#L16-L32) example on how to use the structure to customize the configuration file.


# Running K3s with Rootless mode (Experimental)

> **Warning:** This feature is experimental.

Rootless mode allows running the entire k3s an unprivileged user, so as to protect the real root on the host from potential container-breakout attacks.

See also https://rootlesscontaine.rs/ to learn about Rootless mode.

### Known Issues with Rootless mode

* **Ports**

    When running rootless a new network namespace is created.  This means that K3s instance is running with networking fairly detached from the host.  The only way to access services run in K3s from the host is to set up port forwards to the K3s network namespace. We have a controller that will automatically bind 6443 and service port below 1024 to the host with an offset of 10000. 

    That means service port 80 will become 10080 on the host, but 8080 will become 8080 without any offset.

    Currently, only `LoadBalancer` services are automatically bound.

* **Cgroups**

    Cgroup v1 is not supported. v2 is supported.

* **Multi-node cluster**

    Multi-cluster installation is untested and undocumented.

### Running Servers and Agents with Rootless
* Enable cgroup v2 delegation, see https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/cgroup2/ .
  This step is optional, but highly recommended for enabling CPU and memory resource limtitation.

* Download `k3s-rootless.service` from [`https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/<VERSION>/k3s-rootless.service`](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/k3s-rootless.service).
  Make sure to use the same version of `k3s-rootless.service` and `k3s`.

* Install `k3s-rootless.service` to `~/.config/systemd/user/k3s-rootless.service`.
  Installing this file as a system-wide service (`/etc/systemd/...`) is not supported.
  Depending on the path of `k3s` binary, you might need to modify the `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3s ...` line of the file.

* Run `systemctl --user daemon-reload`

* Run `systemctl --user enable --now k3s-rootless`

* Run `KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/k3s.yaml kubectl get pods -A`, and make sure the pods are running.

> **Note:** Don't try to run `k3s server --rootless` on a terminal, as it doesn't enable cgroup v2 delegation.
> If you really need to try it on a terminal, prepend `systemd-run --user -p Delegate=yes --tty` to create a systemd scope.
>
> i.e., `systemd-run --user -p Delegate=yes --tty k3s server --rootless`

### Troubleshooting

* Run `systemctl --user status k3s-rootless` to check the daemon status
* Run `journalctl --user -f -u k3s-rootless` to see the daemon log
* See also https://rootlesscontaine.rs/

# Node Labels and Taints

K3s agents can be configured with the options `--node-label` and `--node-taint` which adds a label and taint to the kubelet. The two options only add labels and/or taints [at registration time,]({{<baseurl>}}/k3s/latest/en/installation/install-options/#node-labels-and-taints-for-agents) so they can only be added once and not changed after that again by running K3s commands.

If you want to change node labels and taints after node registration you should use `kubectl`. Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for details on how to add [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) and [node labels.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/#add-a-label-to-a-node)

# Starting the Server with the Installation Script

The installation script will auto-detect if your OS is using systemd or openrc and start the service.
When running with openrc, logs will be created at `/var/log/k3s.log`. 

When running with systemd, logs will be created in `/var/log/syslog` and viewed using `journalctl -u k3s`.

An example of installing and auto-starting with the install script:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

When running the server manually you should get an output similar to the following:

```
$ k3s server

```

The output will likely be much longer as the agent will create a lot of logs. By default the server
will register itself as a node (run the agent).

# Additional Preparation for Alpine Linux Setup

In order to set up Alpine Linux, you have to go through the following preparation:

Update **/etc/update-extlinux.conf** by adding:

```
default_kernel_opts="...  cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory"
```

Then update the config and reboot:

```bash
update-extlinux
reboot
```

# Running K3d (K3s in Docker) and docker-compose

[k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d) is a utility designed to easily run K3s in Docker.

It can be installed via the the [brew](https://brew.sh/) utility on MacOS:

```
brew install k3d
```

`rancher/k3s` images are also available to run the K3s server and agent from Docker. 

A `docker-compose.yml` is in the root of the K3s repo that serves as an example of how to run K3s from Docker. To run from `docker-compose` from this repo, run:

    docker-compose up --scale agent=3
    # kubeconfig is written to current dir

    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml get node

    NAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    497278a2d6a2   Ready    <none>   11s   v1.13.2-k3s2
    d54c8b17c055   Ready    <none>   11s   v1.13.2-k3s2
    db7a5a5a5bdd   Ready    <none>   12s   v1.13.2-k3s2

To run the agent only in Docker, use `docker-compose up agent`.

Alternatively the `docker run` command can also be used:

    sudo docker run \
      -d --tmpfs /run \
      --tmpfs /var/run \
      -e K3S_URL=${SERVER_URL} \
      -e K3S_TOKEN=${NODE_TOKEN} \
      --privileged rancher/k3s:vX.Y.Z


# Enabling legacy iptables on Raspbian Buster

Raspbian Buster defaults to using `nftables` instead of `iptables`.  **K3S** networking features require `iptables` and do not work with `nftables`.  Follow the steps below to switch configure **Buster** to use `legacy iptables`:
```
sudo iptables -F
sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
sudo reboot
```

# Enabling cgroups for Raspbian Buster

Standard Raspbian Buster installations do not start with `cgroups` enabled. **K3S** needs `cgroups` to start the systemd service. `cgroups`can be enabled by appending `cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory` to `/boot/cmdline.txt`.

### example of /boot/cmdline.txt
```
console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=58b06195-02 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
```

# SELinux Support

_Supported as of v1.19.4+k3s1. Experimental as of v1.17.4+k3s1._

If you are installing K3s on a system where SELinux is enabled by default (such as CentOS), you must ensure the proper SELinux policies have been installed. 

### Automatic Installation

_Available as of v1.19.3+k3s2_

The [install script]({{<baseurl>}}/k3s/latest/en/installation/install-options/#installation-script-options) will automatically install the SELinux RPM from the Rancher RPM repository if on a compatible system if not performing an air-gapped install. Automatic installation can be skipped by setting `INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_SELINUX_RPM=true`.

### Manual Installation

The necessary policies can be installed with the following commands:
```
yum install -y container-selinux selinux-policy-base
yum install -y https://rpm.rancher.io/k3s/latest/common/centos/7/noarch/k3s-selinux-0.2-1.el7_8.noarch.rpm
```

To force the install script to log a warning rather than fail, you can set the following environment variable: `INSTALL_K3S_SELINUX_WARN=true`.

### Enabling and Disabling SELinux Enforcement

The way that SELinux enforcement is enabled or disabled depends on the K3s version.

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "K3s v1.19.1+k3s1" %}}

To leverage SELinux, specify the `--selinux` flag when starting K3s servers and agents.

This option can also be specified in the K3s [configuration file:]({{<baseurl>}}/k3s/latest/en/installation/install-options/#configuration-file)

```
selinux: true
```

The `--disable-selinux` option should not be used. It is deprecated and will be either ignored or will be unrecognized, resulting in an error, in future minor releases.

Using a custom `--data-dir` under SELinux is not supported. To customize it, you would most likely need to write your own custom policy. For guidance, you could refer to the [containers/container-selinux](https://github.com/containers/container-selinux) repository, which contains the SELinux policy files for Container Runtimes, and the [rancher/k3s-selinux](https://github.com/rancher/k3s-selinux) repository, which contains the SELinux policy for K3s .

{{%/tab%}}
{{% tab "K3s before v1.19.1+k3s1" %}}

SELinux is automatically enabled for the built-in containerd.

To turn off SELinux enforcement in the embedded containerd, launch K3s with the `--disable-selinux` flag.

Using a custom `--data-dir` under SELinux is not supported. To customize it, you would most likely need to write your own custom policy. For guidance, you could refer to the [containers/container-selinux](https://github.com/containers/container-selinux) repository, which contains the SELinux policy files for Container Runtimes, and the [rancher/k3s-selinux](https://github.com/rancher/k3s-selinux) repository, which contains the SELinux policy for K3s .

# Additional preparation for (Red Hat/CentOS) Enterprise Linux

It is recommended to turn off firewalld:
```
systemctl disable firewalld --now
```

If enabled, it is required to disable nm-cloud-setup and reboot the node:
```
systemctl disable nm-cloud-setup.service nm-cloud-setup.timer
reboot
```

# Enabling Lazy Pulling of eStargz (Experimental)

### What's lazy pulling and eStargz?

Pulling images is known as one of the time-consuming steps in the container lifecycle.
According to [Harter, et al.](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast16/technical-sessions/presentation/harter),

> pulling packages accounts for 76% of container start time, but only 6.4% of that data is read

To address this issue, k3s experimentally supports *lazy pulling* of image contents.
This allows k3s to start a container before the entire image has been pulled.
Instead, the necessary chunks of contents (e.g. individual files) are fetched on-demand. 
Especially for large images, this technique can shorten the container startup latency.

To enable lazy pulling, the target image needs to be formatted as [*eStargz*](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/stargz-estargz.md).
This is an OCI-alternative but 100% OCI-compatible image format for lazy pulling.
Because of the compatibility, eStargz can be pushed to standard container registries (e.g. ghcr.io) as well as this is *still runnable* even on eStargz-agnostic runtimes.

eStargz is developed based on the [stargz format proposed by Google CRFS project](https://github.com/google/crfs) but comes with practical features including content verification and performance optimization.
For more details about lazy pulling and eStargz, please refer to [Stargz Snapshotter project repository](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter).

### Configure k3s for lazy pulling of eStargz

As shown in the following, `--snapshotter=stargz` option is needed for k3s server and agent.

```
k3s server --snapshotter=stargz
```

With this configuration, you can perform lazy pulling for eStargz-formatted images.
The following Pod manifest uses eStargz-formatted `node:13.13.0` image (`ghcr.io/stargz-containers/node:13.13.0-esgz`).
k3s performs lazy pulling for this image.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nodejs
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nodejs-estargz
    image: ghcr.io/stargz-containers/node:13.13.0-esgz
    command: ["node"]
    args:
    - -e
    - var http = require('http');
      http.createServer(function(req, res) {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello World!\n');
      }).listen(80);
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

# Additional Logging Sources

[Rancher logging]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/logging/helm-chart-options/) for K3s can be installed without using Rancher. The following instructions should be executed to do so:

```
helm repo add rancher-charts https://charts.rancher.io
helm repo update
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-logging-system rancher-logging-crd rancher-charts/rancher-logging-crd
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-logging-system rancher-logging --set additionalLoggingSources.k3s.enabled=true rancher-charts/rancher-logging
```
